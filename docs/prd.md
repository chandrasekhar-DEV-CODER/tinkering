# My School Ride MVP System Specification

## 1. Website Name
My School Ride - School Bus Tracking Management System (MVP Version)

## 2. Website Description
A comprehensive school bus management platform providing unified login portal supporting four user roles: administrators, drivers, students, and parents. Core capabilities include: complete vehicle, driver, student, and parent management by administrators; real-time GPS location reporting by drivers; live bus tracking for students and parents; push notification alerts; and visual route management.

## 3. Core Functional Modules

### 3.1 Unified Login System
- **Unified Login Portal**: All user types (administrators, drivers, students, parents) access the system through a single login page
- **Role Selection Mechanism**: Login page provides dropdown menu or button group for users to select their role before entering credentials
- **Role Verification**: System validates username and password against the corresponding database table based on selected role
- **Admin-Specific Route**: Accessing `/adminherelogin` automatically redirects to login page with admin role pre-selected
- **Pre-configured Super Admin Account**:
  - Username: `chandrasekharadmin`
  - Password: `chandrasekharadmin1023@@`
- JWT authentication and session management
- **Universal Credential System**: All user accounts (administrators, drivers, students, parents) are created with username and password credentials

      setBuses(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        [data.busId]: data\n      }));
    });
    return () => socket.off('admin:all_buses_update');\n  }, [socket]);

  return (
